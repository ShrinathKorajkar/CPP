🔷 OOP in C# (Very High Priority)
Core OOP
Difference between class vs struct vs record
Reference types vs value types (memory + performance)
What is boxing / unboxing?
How does inheritance work in C# internally?
Why multiple inheritance is not supported (and how interfaces solve it)
virtual, override, abstract, sealed
Difference between virtual, abstract, override, new
When to use sealed methods/classes?
Virtual call overhead in C#
Can constructors be virtual? (Why not)
static
Static class vs instance class
Static constructor – when is it called?
Thread-safety of static members
Singleton vs static class
Constructors / Finalizers
Constructor chaining
Private constructors (use cases)
Finalizers (~ClassName) vs IDisposable
Why finalizers are discouraged?
Deep vs Shallow Copy
What does MemberwiseClone() do?
How to implement deep copy?
Difference between copy constructor vs ICloneable
Immutable objects and copying
Operator Overloading
Which operators can be overloaded?
Pre/post increment behavior in C#
Why operator overloading is rare in business apps
Overloading == and Equals together (very important)
🔷 Generics (C# equivalent of Templates)
Generics Basics
Generics vs non-generics (type safety + performance)
Generic methods vs generic classes
Constraints
where T : class
where T : struct
where T : new()
Why constraints matter
Covariance / Contravariance
out and in keywords
Why IEnumerable<T> is covariant
Why List<T> is invariant
Runtime vs Compile-time
Why generics are reified in .NET (unlike Java)
How CLR handles generic instantiation
🔷 Collections (STL equivalent)
Collection Types (Must Know)
List<T> vs Array
Dictionary<TKey,TValue> vs ConcurrentDictionary
HashSet<T>
Queue<T>, Stack<T>
Span<T> / Memory<T> (advanced, high-value)
Internal Working (Frequently Asked)
List<T> resizing strategy
Dictionary hashing + collision handling
Why dictionary lookup is O(1) average
Why ConcurrentDictionary is slower than Dictionary
Enumerators & Iterators
Why IEnumerable<T> exists
Deferred execution
What happens when you enumerate twice?
🔷 LINQ (Very Important)
IEnumerable vs IQueryable
Deferred vs immediate execution
Select vs SelectMany
First vs FirstOrDefault
Performance pitfalls of LINQ
Why LINQ can hide bugs
🔷 Memory Management & GC (CRITICAL)
Garbage Collector
How GC works in .NET (high-level)
Generations (Gen 0, 1, 2)
Large Object Heap (LOH)
What causes GC pressure?
IDisposable & RAII equivalent
Why using exists
Dispose vs Finalizer
When to implement IDisposable
Common memory leak patterns in C#
🔷 Multithreading & Async (VERY HIGH PRIORITY)
Threads & Tasks
Thread vs Task
Thread pool
When NOT to create threads manually
Async / Await
How async/await works internally
What is a SynchronizationContext?
async void vs async Task
Deadlocks caused by .Result / .Wait()
Locks & Synchronization
lock keyword (Monitor)
Mutex vs SemaphoreSlim
ReaderWriterLockSlim
SpinLock – when to use?
Thread Safety
Immutable objects
Thread-safe collections
Double-checked locking
Volatile keyword
Race Conditions & Deadlocks
Common deadlock scenarios
How to avoid deadlocks
Producer–Consumer pattern in C#
🔷 SOLID Principles (Very Common)
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open–Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Expect:
👉 “Which SOLID principles did you apply in your project?”
🔷 Design Patterns (Extremely Important)
MUST KNOW (Same as your C++ list)
Singleton (thread-safe versions)
Factory / Abstract Factory
Strategy
Observer (events, delegates)
Adapter
Builder
.NET-specific angle
How DI frameworks implement Factory
Why Singleton is often discouraged
Events as Observer pattern
🔷 .NET Runtime & Architecture (Interview Favorite)
CLR vs CTS vs CLS
JIT vs AOT
Assembly loading
Strong-named assemblies
AppDomain (legacy vs modern .NET)
🔷 ASP.NET / Backend (If applicable)
ASP.NET Core request pipeline
Middleware
Dependency Injection lifetime:
Singleton
Scoped
Transient
Model binding
Filters vs Middleware
🔷 Tooling & Ecosystem
Git
Rebase vs merge
Cherry-pick
Resolving conflicts
Gitflow basics
Build & Deployment
dotnet build, dotnet publish
MSBuild basics
NuGet package management
Versioning
Testing
Unit testing frameworks (xUnit, NUnit)
Mocking (Moq)
Why dependency injection helps testing
Docker
Dockerfile for .NET app
Multi-stage builds
Container vs VM
Debugging
Visual Studio debugger
Breakpoints, watch, call stack
Memory dump analysis (basic idea)
Logging vs debugging
