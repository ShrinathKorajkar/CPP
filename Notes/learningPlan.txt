# Topics    
    OOP - rule of 0/3/5, virtual keyword, static, deep vs shallow copy, constructor/destructor, how inheritance happens at memory level, operator overloading - (++pre, post++, new, delete, <<, [], (), conversion operator)
    Templates - function vs class templates, template specialization, compilation model, typename vs class, SFINAE
    STL - container types, all methods they provide, why iterators exist, internal working for - priority_queue, vector, map, unordered_map, deque. functors vs lambdas.
    C++11 - smart pointers, move semantics, lambdas, RAII.
    Multithreading :- join vs detach, lock_guard vs unique_lock, atomic, mutex, condition variable, thread-safe design, semaphore, deadlocks, race conditions, produce-consumer problems, and how to solve these. type of locks - implement your own custom version of these. Async, future, promise
    SOLID,
    design patterns - Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Adapter, Builder (MUST KNOW - Very High Usage, Almost Every Project)
    thread/process synchronization basics,
    memory allocation,
    Git,
    CMake,
    GTest,
    debugging tools (GDB, Valgrind, internal working of these).
    domain Knowledge - Networking, OS, File system, Linux system programming, optimisations, protocols etc.
    Most commonly used in DSA :- sort,find,accumulate,transform,min,max,swap,min_element,max_element,fill,replace,to_string,stoi,splice, time/space complexity, custom comparator in sort

# Resume
   C++ / Linux systems engineer with 2.5+ years of experience building 
   performance-critical, multithreaded firmware and networking systems.

   Currently working on HP Anyware (PCoIP-based remote desktop solutions),
   developing core protocol features, multi-threaded managers, and system-level
   optimizations on Linux.

   Strong hands-on experience in:
   • Modern C++ (C++11/14), memory management, RAII, OOPs
   • Multithreading, synchronization, race condition & deadlock handling
   • Linux systems programming, debugging (GDB), CMake
   • Networking protocols (TCP/IP, PCoIP), USB session handling
   • Security & auth features including SCEP and smart card authentication

   Led development of a critical feature that directly contributed to client
   retention and multi-year contract renewal. Reduced firmware image size by 30%
   through architectural refactoring, improving boot time and memory efficiency.

   Actively exploring strong product teams working on systems, platforms,
   networking, or low-latency backend infrastructure.

   • Worked on HP Anyware (PCoIP-based remote desktop platform) developing
   performance-critical firmware and system components in C++ on Linux.
   • Implemented and debugged core PCoIP session protocol features using
   multi-threaded managers handling concurrent client sessions.
   • Designed and implemented USB session handling and smart card authentication
   flows, including SCEP-based certificate operations.
   • Reduced firmware image size by ~30% by refactoring architecture to separate
   client and host managers, eliminating redundant legacy components and
   improving boot time and memory usage.
   • Led development of a business-critical feature delivered under tight
   deadlines, directly contributing to client retention and contract renewal.
   • Wrote unit tests using GTest achieving 85%+ coverage and improving system
   stability.
   • Mentored and onboarded junior C++ developers and interns.

   Food recommendation engine
      Designed and built a multithreaded C++ client-server system using sockets and
      MySQL, implementing role-based access and recommendation logic.
      Applied SOLID principles, Singleton pattern, serialization/deserialization,
      and unit testing using GTest.

   Elevator Simulation
      Developed a real-time multithreaded elevator coordination system in C++,
      handling concurrent I/O and dynamic scheduling.
      Designed synchronization logic to avoid race conditions and deadlocks,
      reducing average wait time by ~60%.
